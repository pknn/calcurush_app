# CALCURUSH

Calcurush starts off with a simple idea, make a Math game that is fun and not too hard that it made you gave up. So I made a multiplication game with 10 levels, each level will have 30 seconds time limit, and the player have to play through each level as fast as you can to get the highest score. In addition to that, players submit their score to the leaderboard to share with the world how good they are.
